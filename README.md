# FemTech Reminder for InterSystems FHIR Contest 

## Introduction

Today in the modern society and fast life, women priorities include not just caring about family and kids, but also building business and career, leaving no time to care about her health and regularly checkups, often not suspecting about developing health issues.

According to research by leading healthcare organizations, early diagnostics and observation may significantly reduce risks of severe women health problems.

Our project helps to solve this problem and allows the user to receive reminders about regular visits to the clinic. We have developed notification system which connects to FHIR data storage, analyses patient's data, and gives a prompt notification to visit a doctor. 


## Summary

This system is a set of components: the server part based on InterSystems IRIS for Health, a cloud-based FHIR server, and two client parts: - telegram bot-reminder and Web GUI.
The server part analyses patient's data and send a notification to visit a doctor or to do laboratory examinations via the telegram bot. Administrators use web-based GUI interface to configure recommendations.


## Map mind

When brainstorming the solution to apply for this contest, our team came up with the following possible use cases for a female health reminder application, and divided them into three levels: top level (blue) describes actors (WHO?), middle layer (yellow) describes use cases (WHAT?) and third level (pink) describes tasks (HOW?)

## Application Layout

* you go to GUI
* create a new recommendation
* go into the telegram bot
